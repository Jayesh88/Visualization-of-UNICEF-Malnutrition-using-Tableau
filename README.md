This dataset is retrieved from https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/malnutrition/

Good nutrition allows children to survive, grow, develop,learn, play, participate and contribute â€“ while malnutrition robs children of their futures and leaves young lives hanging in the balance. 

## Types of Malnutrition:

The percentage of children who have low weight for age (underweight) can reflect 'wasting' (i.e. low weight for height), indicating acute weight loss, 'stunting', or both. Thus, 'underweight' is a composite indicator and may therefore be difficult to interpret."-WHO . As we can see that Stunting and Wasting has strong correlation with Underweight so we decided to compute correlation matrix and found that underweight has 90% correlation with stunting and 80% correlation with wasting, which can be seen in figure below.

## Dashboard Screenshot
Dashboard is built in such a way that whenever you select the filter from the type of malutrition it gives the information based on the type of malnutrition selected, which country in the world has been affected the most, which continent has its effect.

It also gives us information about which type of income group is having the highest impact.

The time series graph tells us about the information regarding impact of different type of malnutrition over the period of time
